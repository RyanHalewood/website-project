    <h3 id="homeheading3">What is ARK: Survival Evolved?</h3>
    <p class="homepara">As a man or woman stranded, naked, freezing, and starving on the unforgiving shores of a mysterious island called ARK, use your skill and cunning to kill or tame and ride the plethora of leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land. Hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements and store valuables, all while teaming up with (or preying upon) hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="homepara">The game was released on August 29th, 2017 after being over two years in 'Early Access' and is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/ARK_Survival_Evolved/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the Xbox Live Marketplace, PlayStation 4, mobile devices, the Nintendo Switch, and the Epic Games Store with continually new updates in the open-world dinosaur survival game.</p>
